debugging at 3am--questioning life choices

the sun is a--deadly lazer
no bitches just code--all day every day
bro thinks hes--the main character
i have no idea--what im doing
rubber duck debugging--but its a rubber chicken
my code is held together-- by hopes and dreams
this function does--what it wants
comments are lies--written in the past
i need coffee--more than i need sleep
the code works--dont ask me how
why is it always--the semicolon
production is down--im down bad
its not a bug--its a feature
the customer always--wants it earlier
this code smells--like regret
im fluent in--spaghetti code
the deadline was--yesterday
ctrl z my life--ctrl z my life
this is my masterpiece--please dont look at it
im not refactoring--im rewriting
this works on my machine--ship it
the code reviews--are brutal
i love programming--but i hate debugging
this mod will--be my downfall
variables named--poopoo peepee
the loop is infinite--help me
this recursion is--deep as hell
my error handling--is nonexistent
the compiler hates--me personally
console.log debugging--is peak performance
im on the sun--im on the sun
im listening to lofi--while writing this
this message--is really rare

my variable names--are self documenting
this is fine--im not stressed
the build is broken--again somehow
